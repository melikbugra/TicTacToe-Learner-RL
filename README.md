# TicTacToe-Learner-RL
A TicTacToe AI (Reinforcement Learning) player agent that learns to play 'O' player in the game from the user agent who plays 'X' agent. Also another program is added: In this program 'X' player is also a AI agent and both AI's learns from each other, so we can use their knowledge in our first program and test them.

In this study, TicTacToe game algorithm and its image resources are taken from AtiByte YouTube channel and here is the link for the reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K14vOZjHNLA&list=PL1P11yPQAo7pJT26yr1_cmfS1g_RX7b4d

I used this resource's code and added AI agents on it.

### Explanations
1. LearnsFromUser
* LearnsFromUser folder contains the program that an RL agent learns how to play TicTacToe from you. It plays against you at the start with no knowledge about the game. It plays randomly. As it plays, it learns how to play the game with real experience, like a baby!
* In res folder, there are the image assets of 'X' and 'O' players.

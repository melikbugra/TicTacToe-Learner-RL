# TicTacToe-Learner-RL
A TicTacToe AI (Reinforcement Learning) player agent that learns to play 'O' player in the game from the user agent who plays 'X' agent. Also another program is added: In this program 'X' player is also a AI agent and both AI's learns from each other, so we can use their knowledge in our first program and test them.
